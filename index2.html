    <h1>Diary of my studying programming</h1>

    <p>
        I have taken the matriculation examination at 2020. Then, our country was faced to coronavirus (Covid 19).I didn't know what I do. I had lost my way. After a few months, I studied English at GYS online class. At this time, I thought that "What is my hobby and interest??". I didn't understand my hobby. For later, I have found the post that was related with programming. I researched about programming and I was so interested in programming. Firstly, I self-studied programming with Youtube videos. For me, studying programming with  YT videos was very difficult. So, I decided to attend a class. I found on facebook. There are many classes. Finally, I decided to attend Myanmar IT Bootcamp. Now, I am studying programming.
